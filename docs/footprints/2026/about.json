  "ai_profile": "**Footprints Festival 2026: A Tapestry of Global Sounds**  \n\nThe Footprints Festival 2026 promises an eclectic musical journey, showcasing a lineup of 11 exceptional artists from across the globe. With genres ranging from electronic and psychedelic to Malian desert blues, Anatolian rock, and gospel, the festival celebrates the intersection of traditional and contemporary sounds. Notable trends include the prominence of electronic acts (3 artists) and the growing influence of psychedelic-infused music, with both psychedelic folk and rock making a strong presence. With an impressive average rating of 7.73, the lineup is both critically acclaimed and diverse in appeal.  \n\nThis year's lineup highlights a commitment to cultural and geographic diversity, featuring artists from 10 different countries, including Germany, Iran, Nigeria, and Brazil. Seven of the 11 performers identify as people of color, reinforcing the festival's dedication to amplifying underrepresented voices. The inclusion of traditional Iranian, Armenian folk, and Afrobeat acts alongside minimalist electropop and 80s-inspired music reflects a vivid celebration of global artistry.  \n\nWhile the lineup leans male (8 male artists to 2 female and 1 mixed-gender act), Footprints Festival continues to foster inclusivity through its rich and varied programming. With every act available to explore on Spotify, attendees can immerse themselves in the sounds of the world before experiencing them live. Footprints 2026 is set to be a vibrant celebration of music's power to unite across borders and cultures.  ",
