Actress & Suzanne Ciani,A groundbreaking collaboration blending experimental electronic textures with modular synthesis and ambient soundscapes.,Thu 9 April,,,,Electronic/Ambient,UK/USA,"Actress & Suzanne Ciani is a collaboration between British electronic producer Actress and American electronic music pioneer Suzanne Ciani, blending experimental electronic textures with modular synthesis and ambient soundscapes.",,https://open.spotify.com/artist/6E7hjfR2Qy6392SnUqCnzr,,,"This collaboration merges Actress's avant-garde electronic production with Suzanne Ciani's pioneering modular synthesis expertise, creating a unique fusion of experimental and ambient electronic music.",8,,Mixed,Yes,,https://www.rewirefestival.nl/artist/actress--suzanne-ciani,,"Five-time Grammy award-nominated composer Suzanne Ciani, an icon and early pioneer of electronic music composition, joins producer Darren J. Cunningham, aka Actress, to perform *Concrète Waves* – the kind of collaboration that only floats to shore once in a lifetime. Ciani's first commercial album, *Seven Waves* (1982) wafted amidst the soothing and playful movements of seafoam – drawing on ocean metaphors to create a bubbling, synthesised body of work. With *Concrète Waves*, Actress and Ciani – with her signature Buchla synthesiser in tow – return to this concept.  

Cunningham's productions as Actress transport musique concrète into the twenty-first century, creating what he terms ""R&B concrète"" – where atmospheric scenes of twinkling ambience and furrowed noise meet sodium-lit field recordings and bassy warped drum sequences. In contrast to this practice – which is painted upon a backdrop of post-industrial urban life – Ciani evokes the natural world in her music.  

Although the duo offer a swell of contradictions, what they do share is a rare ability to build atmosphere and environment through electronics, texture, and timbre. It is in the overlapping middle-points between the natural and the metropolitan that their sound dwells – where roots entangle city infrastructure or, indeed, where the ocean waves crash up into modern life.  

Actress & Suzanne Ciani will perform an exclusive show at Amare during Rewire 2026.","{""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/sevwave/"", ""Website"": ""https://www.sevwave.com/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://modernobscuremusic.bandcamp.com/""}",Yes

While these play energetically with synthesis and complex rhythmic ideas, her 2024 album Seven Reorganisations, the inaugural release on Dillon’s own new label, HI, turns towards the patient, the minimal, and the purely acoustic – forming a resoundingly touching contemporary classical piece, performed by fellow London-based sextet Explore Ensemble. Their artful interpretations are at the forefront of Seven Reorganisations. Among piano inflections and minimal string lines, an ecosystem of organic, murmuring sounds comes alive. As if through magic, the performers dissolve into their instruments; the space around them is made to feel as if it's engulfed in anti-matter – and that all which exists is the animated instruments creating sounds in a lively macrocosm of vibration and timbre. 

In a world premiere performance, Beatrice Dillon and Explore Ensemble present Dillon’s major new composition, which incorporates Dillon’s digital synthesis with the Ensemble's acoustic instrumentation.

On her last album, *Myuthafoo* (2023), cavernous analogue synth soundscapes ring out with brilliant sustain that evaporates into the air. Before that, *Spirit Exit* (2022) offered an icy synth opus of compositions whose arpeggiated melodies were as complex as they were catchy. Barbieri's approach to music is surely theoretically grounded, yet her manifold compositions and works are also deeply intuitive.

His foundational album *Keyboard Fantasies* (1986) – written and performed on with a Yamaha DX7, a Roland TR-707, and with Copeland's unique voice – is now considered a groundbreaking release, far ahead of its time. It combined new-age minimalism, early Detroit techno rhythms, and the humble warmth of traditional songwriting into a blooming nursery of new sounds that still sounds fresh, 40 years on. Originally released in a small cassette run, it was considered a near-lost overlooked classic until it found its way into the spotlight through word of mouth, before being reissued in the late 2010s – leading to a re-flourishing of Copeland's musical career, which included reissues of his earlier work, like his debut self-titled album (1970), but also the development of new music which develops further his sound: gentle folk-jazz explorations, compelling gospel harmonies, and West African drumming, all accompanied by his singular voice.

Copeland is joined at Rewire 2026 by his wife and collaborator, Elizabeth Copeland – she is a theatre artist, writer, producer, and arts educator whose work over the past forty-plus years traverses arts and activism.","{""Website"": ""https://beverlyglenncopeland.com/"", ""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/elspeth_glenn/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://beverlyglenn-copeland.bandcamp.com/""}",Yes

On one side of the collaboration, Treanor's crisp, bassy, and often minimal productions form the bedrock upon which Tolmie, on the other side, builds pillars of sound with her incredible voice – moving between poetic spoken word and bristling exasperated singing, at times recalling the trembling vocal outbursts of early Björk. She speaks and sings stream-of-consciousness incantations through her somatic and self-developed internal singing technique. Treanor plays with her voice, chopping up samples, creating a mimicking effect that weaves magically into the duo's disorienting and surreal music. Flirting with PC music aesthetics and hyper-pop frequencies, the music is at times squeaky and staccato, but there is always a rave-inspired barrage of bass waiting around the corner. Between Treanor's bassy interventions and Tolmie's erupting vocals, there is a sense of push and pull, encapsulated perfectly by the duo's ecstatic and bodily live performances.","{""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/cara.tolmie/"", ""Website"": ""https://riantreanor.com/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://riantreanor.bandcamp.com/""}",Yes

Focussing around generative techniques and the creative potential of computation, and using vivid modular synthesis and expanded electro-acoustic formats, Barbieri examines states of trance and altered consciousness. Her approach to music is surely theoretically grounded, yet her manifold compositions and works are also deeply intuitive. She treats her compositions as living organisms which are developed and altered through live performance.

Their folkloric trip-hop takes existing historical and cultural source material – such as a mid-twentieth-century folklore journal, a book on Welsh myths, and another on Bronze-Age human remains – and drags it into the modern era. Their latest release, Remscéla (2025), is a partial reimagining of Irish poet Thomas Kinsella's canonical translation of the Irish pagan epic, Táin Bó Cúailnge – the tale of an invader queen who seeks to plunder a magical bull from her former husband. In the same way that these remscéla act as a preface in Kinsella's translation, Milkweed's album of the same title is a beautiful, curious introduction to what one can expect at one of their live shows: two mysterious people heartedly keeping oral storytelling traditions alive through wispy song and mischievous experimentation.","{""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/mlkwd_/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://milkweedfolk.bandcamp.com/""}",Yes
Oneohtrix Point Never,Experimental electronic music innovator,,,,,Electronic/Ambient/Experimental,USA,"Oneohtrix Point Never, the project of Daniel Lopatin, is known for its groundbreaking work in experimental electronic music, blending ambient, noise, and avant-garde elements.

His innovative approach to sound design and his work in film scoring have solidified his reputation as a leading figure in contemporary electronic music.",9,,Male,No,,https://www.rewirefestival.nl/artist/oneohtrix-point-never-2026,,"At a stage of his career where many others might settle into a predictable flow, Daniel Lopatin continues to burst the banks of expectation, flooding out and forming new tributaries of strange cybernetic sounds. November saw the release on the iconic Warp Records of his 11th studio album, the critically acclaimed Tranquilizer (2025) – a slightly misleading title, considering how revitalising and energetic it is. From soft synthesizer swells and ambient strings to sweltering percussive builds and bursts of clattering maximalism, Lopatin's music remains a contested site of both sensitive storytelling and chaotic playfulness. A true artisan of worldbuilding through sound and of playing with overlooked and forgotten sonic materials, for Tranquilizer, Lopatin quite literally assembled the music from the wreckage of commercial sample CDs, salvaged from the Internet Archive. As with much of his work, he draws humanity out from these otherwise innocuous sources of mellotron muzak, warbly melody, and chorus-drenched guitar. For Rewire’s 15th anniversary edition, Oneohtrix Point Never makes his return to the festival. Accompanied by celebrated visual artist Freeka Tet, OPN presents a live performance built around the new album. Any of those graced by the OPN performance at Rewire two years ago will know to expect the unexpected. Catch this Netherlands-exclusive performance at Rewire in Amare's grandiose Concertzaal.","{""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/eccopn/"", ""Website"": ""https://pointnever.com/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://oneohtrixpointnever.bandcamp.com/""}",Yes
Raül Refree & Niño de Elche,Experimental flamenco innovators,,,,,Flamenco/Experimental,Spain,"Raül Refree & Niño de Elche are a Spanish duo known for their experimental approach to flamenco, blending traditional elements with avant-garde and electronic influences.

Following five years of touring together, the cult duo released their first collaborative album together in late 2025.Cru+esbrings together the mutant flamenco-infused electronica of Refree – who has produced for and collaborated with artists such as Rosalía and Sílvia Pérez Cruz – with the booming yet sensitive vocals of Niño de Elche – a stalwart of and beloved figure in Spanish avant-garde music. In a collision of tradition and futurity, the duo envision a new kind of flamenco sound where stirring, emotive vocals and palm-muted nylon strings get cozy next to galactic synthesis, heartworn ambience, and big, bassy production. What emerges from this unlikely yet somehow perfect collision of sounds is a distorted and ethereal kind of post-pop that bears little resemblance to other contemporary song-making approaches.","{""Website"": ""https://www.raulrefree.com/"", ""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/ninodeelche/""}",Yes

The outcome of this special, once-in-a-blue-moon kind of collaboration was *The Film* (2025), an uncompromising work of sludgy metal, experimental guitar music, and cutting-edge spoken word. While amplifier hums, scattered frequencies, and barrages of power chords and drums form the spine of *The Film*, it's Moor Mother's verses that pump its heart: speaking her close-held truths, she shares them abundantly with a cutting clarity that strikes through the cacophonous sludge battery of Sumac. Swirling convection currents of snarling riffs flow in and around Moor Mother's poetic and punchy commentary, which not just speaks but howls truth to power.","{""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/bubblegutz/"", ""Website"": ""https://moormother.net/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://sumac.bandcamp.com/""}",No

The band rose to prominence in the mid-90s by taking the familiar independent rock ingredients of the era and tossing them into a frothy kraut-jazz cauldron: from this effervescent mirth, their iconic, creative, rhythmic sound bubbled up into existence. Tortoise offered a different kind of band sound: urgent, strange, unpredictable, and, above all, new. From being early pioneers of experimental rock on their first two albums, the introduction of guitarist Parker to the group before their lauded third album TNT (1999) brought a cosmic free-jazz spirit to the group that has remained a staple quality of their sound since. The other elements that make up Tortoise span ambient, kraut rock, noise, electronics, and indie rock – each taking different space in their decades-spanning releases. Almost 10 years since the 8-bit odyssey of 2016's The Catastrophist, Tortoise returned in 2025 with a new single ""Oganesson."" This sleek, jazz-inflected song teases what can be expected on their forthcoming album Touch on beloved label International Anthem and Nonesuch Records.","{""Website"": ""https://www.trts.com/"", ""Instagram"": ""https://www.instagram.com/trts/"", ""Bandcamp"": ""https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/""}",Yes
