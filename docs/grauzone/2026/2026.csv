Oh Non,,,,,,"alternative rock, new wave, chanson française",France,"[using festival bio due to a lack of publicly available data] OH NON (Fr)OH NON is a French quintet operating at the crossroads of alternative rock, new wave, and eccentric chanson française. Drawing inspiration from Boris Vian, Brigitte Fontaine, Stereo Total, Pixies, and B-52’s, their music is playful, theatrical, razor-sharp, and utterly unpredictable. With humor, irony, and emotional vulnerability woven throughout their lyrics, OH NON tackles modern anxieties—urban alienation, nightlife absurdities, and the awkward negotiations of human relationships—all delivered through surreal, witty, and highly energetic songwriting.Their universe is rich with its own symbols, logic, and offbeat charm. Switching effortlessly between buzzing guitars, disco-infused grooves, scat-like vocal textures, noise bursts, and deadpan spoken-word, they occupy a unique niche in the French musical landscape: too strange for pop, too melodic for pure punk, too fun for the avant-garde—and beloved by audiences who feel equally “in between.”In 2024, OH NON released their first self-titled EP, a six-track introduction to their dreamlike and burlesque world. The lead singleLes Filles des Filmsset the tone with a surreal video that quickly captured attention. In 2025, they returned with the surf-styled singleCaïman, a cinematic mini-story about a woman walking her pet caiman through Paris—a whimsical, biting metaphor for modern chaos.OH NON brings together the grumpiest and the shyest, the punks and the romantics, around a shared love for oddball beauty and inclusivity.
