  "ai_profile": "**Alkmaarse Eigenste 2026: A Festival of Unique Flavor**  \n\nAlkmaarse Eigenste 2026 brings together 25 artists, showcasing a melting pot of styles with a particular nod to blues rock, garage rock, and swampy roots influences. While the festival leans heavily on unique and niche sounds, it remains united by its celebration of raw, authentic artistry. Notably, there are no DJs featured this year, emphasizing the festival's focus on live, instrument-driven performances.  \n\nIn terms of diversity, the lineup is predominantly from the Netherlands, with three artists officially listed as Dutch, reflecting a strong local connection. However, there’s limited gender representation, with only two female artists and one male artist explicitly identified, leaving most artist profiles unspecified. Similarly, while three artists are confirmed as non-POC, the backgrounds of the majority remain unknown, offering room for greater transparency and inclusivity in future editions.  \n\nInterestingly, none of the artists are linked to Spotify, and all remain unrated, suggesting a focus on discovery and an embrace of lesser-known or emerging talent. Alkmaarse Eigenste 2026 promises to be a festival rooted in individuality and grassroots creativity, offering attendees a chance to experience something truly distinctive and unpolished."
