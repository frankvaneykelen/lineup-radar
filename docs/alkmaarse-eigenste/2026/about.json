  "ai_profile": "**Festival Profile: Alkmaarse Eigenste 2026**\n\nAlkmaarse Eigenste 2026 celebrates a rich tapestry of alternative and indie music, with a lineup of 25 Dutch artists spanning an impressive array of genres. From alternative and rock to indie pop and soul, the festival embraces diversity in sound, with notable appearances by acts exploring unique styles such as alt-pop-noir, ambient pop, and swampy roots influences. With no DJs on the roster, the festival focuses on live performances, showcasing the breadth and depth of the Netherlands' music scene.\n\nThe festival highlights a commendable balance of representation, with a mix of male (9), female (7), and band-led (4) performances, alongside a small segment of artists with undisclosed gender identities. While the majority of the lineup consists of artists who do not identify as people of color, the inclusion of at least one artist of color is a step toward broader representation. This blend of artists ensures a platform for diverse voices and perspectives in a predominantly Dutch lineup.\n\nWith an impressive average rating of 10.0 (albeit most artists remain unrated), and all acts featuring Spotify links for easy discovery, Alkmaarse Eigenste 2026 is poised to be a standout celebration of the Netherlands’ musical talent. This festival is a must-visit for those seeking a fresh yet eclectic mix of alternative and indie sounds, with an emphasis on authenticity and artistry."
