The festival showcases a strong focus on alternative and indie genres, with highlights including alternative rock, indie rock, dream pop, and shoegaze. A variety of other genres—ranging from blues rock and americana to electronic pop and reggae—add depth and diversity to the lineup, ensuring something for every music lover. The festival’s eclectic mix of sounds reflects its commitment to embracing the many facets of Dutch musical talent.\n\nThe event also shines a light on gender diversity, with a balanced representation of female and male artists, alongside bands and artists of unspecified gender. However, the lineup is less diverse in terms of racial representation, with only one artist identified as a person of color. While this indicates room for growth, the festival’s wide array of genres and artistic styles creates a platform for unique and varied voices within the Dutch music scene.\n\nAlkmaarse Eigenste 2026 has received a warm reception, with an average artist rating of 8.63 from 76% of the lineup. Notably, 11 artists received outstanding ratings in the 9-10 range, highlighting the high caliber of talent gracing the festival.
