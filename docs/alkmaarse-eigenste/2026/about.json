The festival features a wide array of genres, with a strong emphasis on alternative (6 artists), rock (4 artists), and alternative pop (3 artists), while also exploring niche sounds like shoegaze, dark folk, and alt-pop-noir. From the soulful tones of indie folk to the electrifying beats of dance pop and synthesizer rock, the lineup promises something for every music lover.  \n\nThe festival highlights a commendable effort in gender representation, featuring 8 female artists alongside 9 male performers, 3 bands, and 5 artists with unspecified gender identities.
