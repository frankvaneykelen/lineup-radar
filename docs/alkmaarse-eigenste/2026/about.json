  "ai_profile": "**Alkmaarse Eigenste 2026: A Celebration of Dutch Musical Diversity**\n\nAlkmaarse Eigenste 2026 is a vibrant showcase of homegrown talent, featuring 25 artists exclusively from the Netherlands. This year’s lineup offers an eclectic mix of genres, from alternative and rock to indie folk and dream pop, with a strong emphasis on alternative styles, which make up nearly half of the performances. With no DJs in the mix, the festival leans heavily into live, instrument-driven music, creating an intimate and authentic experience for attendees.\n\nThe festival highlights a commendable balance in gender representation, with female artists making up a significant portion of the lineup (8 out of 25), alongside male performers, bands, and some artists whose gender identities are not specified. However, there is room for growth in terms of racial diversity, as only one artist of color is confirmed to be part of the event, with others either not disclosed or not identified as such. Despite this, the festival promises a rich tapestry of sounds, from gothic and dark folk to reggae, soul, and traditional music, reflecting a broad spectrum of artistic expression.\n\nWith an impressive average rating of 10.0, Alkmaarse Eigenste 2026 sets a high bar for quality and audience satisfaction. All 25 artists are also featured on Spotify, making it easy for attendees to explore their music beforehand. This festival is a testament to the thriving and multifaceted Dutch music scene, offering something for every listener while staying true to its roots.",
