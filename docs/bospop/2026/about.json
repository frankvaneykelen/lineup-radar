This year’s lineup reflects Bospop’s commitment to blending classic sounds with fresh, innovative styles, ensuring there’s something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nThe festival highlights a strong international presence, with artists hailing from 10 countries. The USA leads with 10 acts, followed by the Netherlands and the UK, each contributing six. Belgium, Canada, Australia, and other nations add to the mix, creating a truly global celebration of music. However, there’s room for improvement in representation, with only five female-led acts and four performers identified as people of color, demonstrating the need for greater inclusivity in future editions.\n\nAudience enthusiasm for Bospop 2026 is evident, with an impressive average artist rating of 8.16 from over 82% of rated acts, and over 90% of those scored above 8. This reflects the festival’s ability to bring together high-caliber performers.
