Rock dominates the festival with 15 acts, complemented by Blues Rock, Alternative Rock, and Indie Rock, showcasing a rich diversity of sounds. Notable additions include genres like Symphonic Metal, Soul, and Funk, alongside niche offerings such as Celtic Punk, Stoner Rock, and Experimental music. This year’s lineup provides something for everyone, from hard-hitting riffs to soulful melodies and electrifying experimental beats.\n\nThe festival continues to spotlight international talent, featuring artists from 10 countries. The USA leads the pack with 10 acts, followed by the Netherlands and the UK, each contributing six artists.
