  "ai_profile": "**Rock Werchter 2026: A Vibrant Musical Mosaic**\n\nRock Werchter 2026 promises an eclectic lineup of 29 artists spanning a diverse array of genres, from Indie Rock and Alternative Rock to Electronic, Pop, and Soul. Indie Rock leads the charge with six acts, followed closely by Alternative Rock and other genres, showcasing the festival's commitment to blending mainstream appeal with niche sounds. With two DJs on the roster and unique styles such as Psychedelic Rock, Jazz Rap, and Ambient also represented, the festival offers something for every kind of music lover.\n\nThe lineup is predominantly international, with the USA (12 acts) and the UK (11 acts) contributing the majority of artists, alongside talent from Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia. While the gender balance leans heavily male (22 male-led acts, compared to three female-led and one non-binary act), there is some diversity with mixed-gender groups and artists of color, though representation in the latter category remains limited. The festival continues to reflect the global music scene while leaving room for growth in inclusivity.\n\nFans can look forward to a high-quality experience, with all 29 acts boasting Spotify links for easy discovery and an impressive average audience rating of 7.62 out of 10. With five acts achieving near-perfect scores (9-10), Rock Werchter 2026 is set to deliver stellar performances that highlight the best of both established and emerging talent. This year's festival promises to be a celebration of musical variety and artistic excellence.",
