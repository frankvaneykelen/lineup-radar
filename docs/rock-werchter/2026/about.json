With a strong presence of Indie Rock (6 artists), Alternative Rock (5), and Electronic and Pop acts (4 each), the festival offers a rich blend of sounds to satisfy both traditional rock enthusiasts and fans of modern, genre-blurring music. Notable niche genres like Dream Pop, Jazz Rap, and Psychedelic Rock add unique textures to this year’s program, ensuring an eclectic musical experience.\n\nThe festival showcases a global roster of talent, with 12 artists hailing from the USA and 11 from the UK, alongside acts from Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia.
