  "ai_profile": "**Rock Werchter 2026: A Celebration of Musical Diversity and Excellence**\n\nRock Werchter 2026 brings together a stellar lineup of 29 artists, showcasing a rich tapestry of genres and styles. With Indie Rock and Alternative Rock leading the charge, the festival also highlights the growing appeal of Electronic, Pop, and Soul music, alongside niche genres like Psychedelic Rock, Jazz Rap, and Ambient. This diverse mix ensures there is something for every music lover, making the festival a true celebration of musical variety.\n\nThe lineup reflects a strong international presence, with acts from the USA (12) and the UK (11) dominating, while Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia add their unique flavors. While the majority of performers are male (22), the inclusion of female, non-binary, and mixed-gender acts signals a step toward greater gender representation. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of racial diversity, as only two artists identify as people of color. \n\nWith an average artist rating of 7.62 and 100% of acts receiving ratings and Spotify links, Rock Werchter 2026 promises a high-quality experience. Notable is the strong critical reception, with a significant portion of the lineup rated 8 or higher. This year’s festival continues to build on its reputation as a world-class event, offering a blend of crowd favorites and emerging talent across a wide range of genres.",
