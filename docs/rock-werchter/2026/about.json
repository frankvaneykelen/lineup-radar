  "ai_profile": "**Rock Werchter 2026 Festival Profile**\n\nRock Werchter 2026 promises an eclectic lineup of 29 artists spanning a rich variety of genres, with an emphasis on Indie Rock (6 artists), Alternative Rock (5 artists), and Electronic and Pop sounds (4 artists each). The festival’s artistic diversity is reflected in its exploration of niche subgenres, from Dream Pop and Psychedelic Rock to Jazz Rap and Ambient. With an average rating of 7.62 and 17 artists scoring 8 or higher, this year’s lineup is poised to deliver quality performances, balancing crowd-pleasing headliners with fresh, experimental acts.\n\nInternationally renowned, Rock Werchter continues its global appeal, featuring artists from six countries. The USA and UK dominate the roster with 12 and 11 acts respectively, while Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia add local and international flavor. Despite its geographic diversity, the festival still faces challenges in representation, with only 2 artists identifying as people of color and a notable gender imbalance—22 male-led acts compared to just 3 female-led and 1 non-binary act.\n\nWhile diversity remains a work in progress, Rock Werchter 2026 celebrates unity through music, exemplified by its ability to bring together genres, styles, and audiences from around the world. With all artists featured on Spotify and two DJs to amp up the energy, the festival promises an unforgettable experience for music lovers seeking both innovation and timeless sounds.",
