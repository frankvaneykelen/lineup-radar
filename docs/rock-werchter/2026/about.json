  "ai_profile": "**Rock Werchter 2026: A Genre-Spanning Celebration**  \nTaking place from July 2–5, 2026, Rock Werchter once again cements its reputation as one of Europe’s premier music festivals by showcasing a dynamic blend of genres and global talent. With 29 artists on the lineup, the festival spans a wide musical spectrum, from the guitar-driven energy of indie rock (6 acts) and alternative rock (5 acts) to the pulsating beats of electronic and pop (4 acts each). Fans of diverse subgenres like dream pop, soul, folk rock, and hip-hop will also find much to love, reflecting the festival’s commitment to curating a rich tapestry of sounds.\n\nThe lineup draws heavily from the USA (12 acts) and the UK (11 acts), but also features homegrown Belgian talent alongside artists from Canada, Germany, and Australia, offering an international flavor that keeps Rock Werchter globally relevant. While the majority of performers are male (22 out of 29), the festival includes female (3), non-binary (1), and mixed-gender (2) acts, signaling a modest step toward inclusivity. However, representation of artists of color remains limited, with just two acts identified as such, pointing to an area for growth in fostering diversity.\n\nRated by all 29 participating acts, the lineup boasts an impressive average rating of 7.76, with 62% receiving scores of 8 or higher. This high level of acclaim underscores Rock Werchter’s ability to attract top-tier talent and maintain its reputation for quality. With every act featured on Spotify, festivalgoers can easily explore the lineup ahead of time, ensuring an unforgettable weekend of music discovery and celebration."
