  "ai_profile": "**Rock Werchter 2026: A Fusion of Genres and Global Talent**\n\nRock Werchter 2026 promises an eclectic lineup of 29 artists, showcasing a rich blend of genres that highlight the festival’s commitment to diversity in sound. With a strong presence of Indie Rock (6 acts) and Alternative Rock (5 acts), the festival stays true to its rock roots while expanding into Electronic (4 acts), Pop (4 acts), and a variety of niche styles, from Dream Pop and Soul to Jazz Rap and Ambient. This year’s lineup also features two DJs, ensuring the festival caters to both live band enthusiasts and electronic music fans alike.\n\nThe festival boasts an international roster, with a heavy representation from the USA (12 artists) and the UK (11 artists), alongside acts from Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia. While the majority of performers are male (22), the inclusion of female (3), non-binary (1), and mixed-gender acts (2) marks a step toward gender diversity. However, there’s room for improvement in representation, as only two acts feature people of color, reflecting the broader need for inclusivity in the rock and alternative music spaces.\n\nWith an impressive average artist rating of 7.62 and nearly 60% of acts scoring above 8, Rock Werchter 2026 is set to deliver high-quality performances. All artists have Spotify links available, making it easy for fans to explore the lineup ahead of time. As always, the festival remains a melting pot of genres and global talent, blending household names with emerging acts to create an unforgettable musical experience.",
