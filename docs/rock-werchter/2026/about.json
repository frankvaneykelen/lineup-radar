With an average rating of 7.62 and 100% of artists rated and available on Spotify, this year’s lineup promises a high-quality experience for all attendees.  \n\nIn terms of geographical representation, the festival highlights a predominantly Western presence, with 12 acts hailing from the USA and 11 from the UK, while Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia also contribute to the mix.
