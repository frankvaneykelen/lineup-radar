  "ai_profile": "**Rock Werchter 2026 Festival Profile**\n\nRock Werchter 2026 promises a dynamic celebration of music, featuring 29 artists spanning a broad spectrum of genres. Indie Rock leads the charge with six acts, closely followed by Alternative Rock, Alternative, Electronic, and Pop, reflecting the festival’s commitment to blending mainstream appeal with edgy, genre-defying performances. With an average artist rating of 7.62 and five acts scoring 9 or higher, attendees can expect top-tier performances and memorable moments.\n\nThe lineup showcases strong representation from both sides of the Atlantic, with artists hailing primarily from the USA (12) and the UK (11), alongside talent from Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Australia. However, diversity in gender and ethnicity remains a work in progress. Male artists dominate the roster (22), with only three female performers, one non-binary artist, and two mixed-gender groups. Similarly, only two acts feature artists of color, highlighting an opportunity for greater inclusivity in future editions.\n\nDespite this, Rock Werchter 2026 continues to stand out for its ability to unite artists across musical styles, from indie and electronic to hip-hop, soul, and folk. The festival’s mix of iconic names and rising stars, coupled with its global reach and high audience ratings, ensures its status as a must-attend event for music lovers. With all acts accessible on Spotify, fans can dive into the music ahead of the big event, building anticipation for an unforgettable experience.",
