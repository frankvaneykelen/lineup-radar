Diversity in terms of artists of color is limited, with only 2 confirmed acts, though the inclusion of genres like Jazz Rap, R&B, and Hip-Hop hints at some cultural breadth.  \n\nWith an impressive average rating of 7.62 and a high proportion of acts rated 8 or above, Rock Werchter continues to deliver quality performances. The lineup promises a mix of familiar names and emerging talent, ensuring there’s something for every music fan.
