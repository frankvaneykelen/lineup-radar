  "ai_profile": "**Best Kept Secret 2026: A Celebration of Diversity and Eclectic Sounds**\n\nThe 2026 edition of Best Kept Secret brings together 52 artists from 16 different countries, showcasing a truly global lineup. With acts hailing from the USA, the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, and as far afield as Ghana, South Africa, and Brazil, the festival promises a rich tapestry of sounds and cultural influences. The genres span an impressive range, from electronic and hip-hop to indie rock, post-punk, and Afrobeat, reflecting the festival's commitment to celebrating eclecticism and breaking musical boundaries.\n\nThis year's lineup also highlights a growing push for diversity. While male artists still dominate the bill (22 acts), the inclusion of female (9), mixed-gender (9), and non-binary (1) performers adds dimension to the event's representation. Additionally, with 12 artists identifying as people of color and several acts rooted in genres like Afropop, highlife, and traditional South African music, the festival continues to amplify underrepresented voices and global sounds.\n\nWith an average artist rating of 7.2 and the majority of performers scoring between 7 and 8, the 2026 lineup promises quality and consistency. From rising stars to established names, the festival offers something for everyone. With all acts connected to Spotify, attendees can explore the lineup in advance, ensuring they don’t miss a moment of the festival’s vibrant and inclusive energy.
