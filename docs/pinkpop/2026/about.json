  "ai_profile": "**Pinkpop 2026: A Fusion of Sounds and Cultures**\n\nPinkpop 2026 brings an eclectic mix of 32 artists, showcasing the festival's dedication to diverse genres and global talent. Alternative Rock takes center stage with 8 acts, followed by Pop (7) and Indie Rock (6), setting the tone for a weekend of dynamic performances. The lineup also features niche genres like Post-Punk Revival, Electropop, and even Rave Rock, offering something for every music lover. With an average artist rating of 6.88, fans can expect solid performances, including standout acts rated 9 and above.\n\nThis year’s lineup highlights a strong international presence, with artists hailing from the United Kingdom, the United States (9 each), and the Netherlands (7), alongside talent from Germany, Canada, and beyond. However, the lineup reveals room for growth in cultural diversity, as only one act includes a person of color. Gender representation is more balanced, with 8 female-led acts and 4 mixed-gender groups, adding important nuance to the traditionally male-dominated music scene.\n\nPinkpop 2026 continues its legacy of blending established and emerging talent, with Spotify links available for all featured artists, ensuring fans can connect with the music before the festival begins. By embracing a wide range of genres and striving for inclusivity, Pinkpop remains an essential destination for music enthusiasts seeking both familiar sounds and fresh discoveries.",
