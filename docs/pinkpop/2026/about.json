  "ai_profile": "**Pinkpop 2026 Festival Profile**\n\nPinkpop 2026 promises a vibrant lineup of 32 artists spanning an eclectic mix of genres, with a strong emphasis on Alternative Rock (8 acts), Pop (7 acts), and Indie Rock (6 acts). The festival continues its legacy of celebrating diverse musical styles, incorporating everything from Electropop and Post-Punk Revival to Grunge and Rave Rock. With all artists featured on Spotify, attendees can easily explore and enjoy the music before the festival begins.\n\nThis year’s edition highlights a global blend of talent, with acts hailing from the United Kingdom and the United States leading the roster (9 artists each), followed by a solid representation from the Netherlands (7 artists). Other countries such as Germany, Canada, and Australia also contribute to the international flair of the event. In terms of gender representation, the lineup skews male (20 acts), though female and mixed-gender acts make up a significant portion (12 acts combined). However, the festival falls short on racial diversity, with only one artist identifying as a person of color.\n\nWith an average rating of 6.88, the lineup leans toward solid crowd-pleasers, with most acts rated between 7 and 8. The festival’s genre diversity, international presence, and established reputation for spotlighting both mainstream and niche artists ensure that Pinkpop 2026 will be a vibrant celebration of music, offering something for every attendee.",
