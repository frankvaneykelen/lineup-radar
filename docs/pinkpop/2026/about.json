Alternative Rock leads the charge with eight acts, closely followed by Pop (7) and Indie Rock (6), while niche genres like Electropunk, Rave Rock, and Symphonic Pop add a unique flavor to the lineup. With an average artist rating of 6.88, the festival promises a solid mix of crowd-pleasers and emerging talent, with a notable 22 performers rated above 7.0 by audiences.\n\nThe lineup highlights an impressive international presence, with acts hailing from the United Kingdom (9), the United States (9), and the Netherlands (7), alongside artists from Germany, Canada, and beyond. However, despite the global reach, there is limited representation from artists of color, with only one performer falling into this category. Gender diversity is more balanced, featuring 8 female-led acts, 4 mixed-gender groups, and 20 male-driven performances, offering a range of perspectives on stage.\n\nWhile the festival leans heavily on rock and indie influences, it also embraces a mix of styles, from Hip-Hop and R&B to Punk Rock and Electronic. This eclectic blend ensures something for every music lover, maintaining Pinkpop’s reputation as a melting pot of sounds. With no DJs on the roster this year, the focus remains firmly on live band performances, keeping the festival’s classic vibe alive while celebrating both established names and fresh talent.",
