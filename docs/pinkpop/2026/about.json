With a strong presence of Alternative Rock (8 acts), Pop (7 acts), and Indie Rock (6 acts), the event promises something for every music lover while also incorporating unique flavors like Electropunk, Rave Rock, and Gothic Rock. The average artist rating of 6.88 reflects a solid lineup, with standout performances expected from the 22 acts rated above 7.  \n\nThe festival embraces international talent, featuring artists from 8 different countries. The United Kingdom and the United States lead the charge, each contributing 9 acts, followed by the Netherlands with 7, highlighting Pinkpop’s strong connection to its home country. Notably, the lineup also includes artists from Canada, Germany, Australia, Belgium, and Sweden, ensuring a truly global musical experience.\n\nWhile male performers dominate the lineup (20 acts), the inclusion of 8 female-led acts and 4 mixed-gender groups reflects growing gender representation.

Pinkpop 2026 continues to evolve as a festival that celebrates both common ground and diversity, bringing together a broad spectrum of sounds, cultures, and voices for an unforgettable musical weekend."
