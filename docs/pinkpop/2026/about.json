  "ai_profile": "**Pinkpop 2026: A Celebration of Diversity in Music**\n\nPinkpop 2026 brings together an eclectic lineup of 32 artists, showcasing a dynamic blend of genres, from crowd favorites like Alternative Rock (8 acts) and Pop (7 acts) to niche styles such as Electropunk, Gothic Rock, and Rave Rock. With an average rating of 6.88 from all rated artists, this year’s festival promises a solid mix of well-loved performers and emerging talent. The strong representation of Indie subgenres, including Indie Rock (6 acts) and Indie Pop (4 acts), highlights the festival’s commitment to spotlighting fresh, innovative sounds.\n\nThis year’s lineup reflects a balanced international flair, with artists hailing from eight countries. The United Kingdom and the United States lead the way with nine acts each, followed by the Netherlands with seven local talents. While the majority of performers are male (20), there is a notable presence of female (8) and mixed-gender (4) acts, signaling efforts towards greater gender representation in the music scene. However, with only one person of color among the artists, there is room for improvement in terms of racial diversity.\n\nPinkpop 2026 continues its tradition of embracing a variety of musical perspectives, ensuring all 32 artists are accessible on Spotify for fans to explore before the festival. With the inclusion of both established names and rising stars, this year’s event is set to deliver a rich and inclusive celebration of music for fans of all tastes.",
