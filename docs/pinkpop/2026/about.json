  "ai_profile": "**Pinkpop Festival 2026 Profile**\n\nPinkpop 2026 showcases a vibrant lineup of 32 artists, predominantly featuring genres that resonate with the festival's legacy, such as Alternative Rock (8 acts) and Pop (7 acts). The festival embraces a diverse range of sounds, from Indie Rock to Electropop, reflecting current musical trends and the eclectic tastes of its audience. This year, the festival leans heavily into rock-infused genres, with a notable representation of Post-Punk and Punk Rock, ensuring a rich auditory experience that caters to both nostalgic fans and new listeners alike.\n\nThe geographical diversity of the lineup is particularly striking, with artists hailing from the United Kingdom and the United States, each contributing 9 acts, alongside a robust representation from the Netherlands (7 acts). This international flavor is complemented by artists from Germany, Canada, and beyond, creating a dynamic cultural exchange on stage. Despite the predominance of male artists (20 out of 32), the presence of 8 female artists and a mixed-gender representation signals a gradual shift towards inclusivity in the festival's programming.\n\nWhile the festival's average rating stands at a respectable 6.88, with a solid number of artists receiving high ratings, the representation of artists of color is notably limited, with only one act identified as a person of color. This highlights an area for growth in future editions, as Pinkpop continues to evolve and embrace a broader spectrum of voices and backgrounds. Overall, Pinkpop 2026 promises an exhilarating lineup that celebrates both the familiar and the innovative in the live music scene.",
