  "ai_profile": "**Pinkpop 2026 Festival Profile**\n\nPinkpop 2026 brings an eclectic lineup of 32 artists, showcasing a vibrant mix of genres with a strong focus on Alternative Rock, Pop, and Indie Rock, which collectively account for over half of the performances. Fans of diverse sounds will also enjoy niche genres like Gothic Rock, Synth-pop, and Rave Rock, highlighting the festival's commitment to musical variety. With a complete 100% Spotify integration for all artists, attendees can easily explore the lineup ahead of the event.\n\nThe festival reflects a global musical landscape, with artists hailing from eight countries. The United Kingdom, United States, and the Netherlands dominate the bill, contributing a combined 25 acts, while Germany, Canada, Australia, Belgium, and Sweden add international flavors. However, diversity in representation remains limited, with only one artist identifying as a person of color and a male-dominated lineup (20 male acts compared to 8 female and 4 mixed-gender acts).\n\nRated by 100% of its lineup, Pinkpop 2026 boasts an average rating of 6.88, with the majority of acts scoring between 7-8. While this suggests a solid overall quality, only a small fraction of artists achieved top-tier ratings (9-10). Nonetheless, the festival’s wide-ranging genres, international roster, and enduring reputation make it a must-attend event for music lovers seeking a mix of familiar favorites and fresh discoveries.",
