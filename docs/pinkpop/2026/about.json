  "ai_profile": "**Pinkpop 2026 Festival Profile**\n\nPinkpop 2026 promises an eclectic lineup of 32 artists spanning a wide array of genres, with a strong emphasis on Alternative Rock (8 acts), Pop (7 acts), and Indie Rock (6 acts). The festival showcases its commitment to variety by including niche genres like Electropunk, Gothic Rock, and Rave Rock alongside crowd-pleasers like Singer-Songwriter, Hip-Hop, and Dance-Pop. With an average artist rating of 6.88 and a majority of acts scoring between 7 and 8, this year’s lineup is bound to deliver quality performances across the board.\n\nThe festival reflects a blend of international and local talent. The United Kingdom and the United States dominate the roster with nine acts each, while the Netherlands makes a strong showing with seven artists, highlighting the event’s Dutch roots. Other countries like Germany, Canada, Australia, and Sweden round out the diverse representation, offering a global musical experience. However, there’s room for improvement in diversity, as only one artist identifies as a person of color, despite the inclusion of multiple genres with cultural significance.\n\nGender representation also sees some progress, with female-fronted (8) and mixed-gender (4) acts making up 37.5% of the lineup, though male representation (20) remains dominant. With every artist offering Spotify links, Pinkpop 2026 ensures accessibility for fans to explore the lineup ahead of the event, making it easier than ever to connect with the festival’s rich and varied musical offering.",
